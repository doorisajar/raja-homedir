This is my repository of personal dotfiles used at work and home. 

# Basic usage
- remove old dotfiles
- run the Makefile
- install `.zrshrc` dependencies
- `omz reload`
- `startup.jl` isn't usable before installing Julia and the required packages

# TODOs
- list or detect `.zsrhc` dependencies
- don't assume `macos` in `.zshrc` since we might be on Linux

Pieces are adapted from multiple sources:
